## Unreleased

**Tooling (slice 600): web demo becomes a fuzz-replay viewer (combat-sandbox retired, map removed)**

The web demo's old shape (user clicks Attack / Move / Dash / Dodge buttons on the active combatant's row, plus a small grid map, plus the event inspector) didn't scale with the engine. Every new planner or condition or class feature wanted its own toolbar button; the four hand-built scenarios couldn't surface emergent-interaction bugs the way the combat-fuzz tool already does (slices 585-598). The "interactive sandbox" framing also competed with the doc-routing the README's quick start now does better (slice 599: `examples/02-combat-encounter` for code, `combat-fuzz` for CLI battles).

This slice realigns the demo around what it's actually good at: showing the engine working. The demo now:

1. Picks a seed (plus mode 1v1/2v2, opponent kind PC/monster, level 1-5, post-battle rest) and runs the same `runBattle()` the CLI uses.
2. Renders a transport (⏮ ⏪ ▶ ⏩ ⏭) over the resulting event log. Each step replays `events.slice(0, cursor)` and re-renders the panels against the resulting state — same `EngineHost` seam that already powered the live commit subscriptions, so no panel needed its own scrub logic.
3. Encodes the full session in the URL hash (`seed`, `mode`, `vs`, `level`, `rest`, `step`) so any moment in any battle is byte-for-byte sharable.

**Extraction so the simulator can run in two contexts**: `runBattle()` and its supporting builders / policy / level-up helpers moved from [scripts/combat-fuzz.ts](scripts/combat-fuzz.ts) into a side-effect-free [scripts/combat-fuzz-core.ts](scripts/combat-fuzz-core.ts) — no `node:fs`, no `process`, browser-safe. [scripts/combat-fuzz.ts](scripts/combat-fuzz.ts) is now a thin CLI front-door (arg parsing, fs writes, markdown summary) that imports the core; [web/main.ts](web/main.ts) imports the same core. `runBattle()`'s return shape collapsed from `{ events, finalState, winner, rounds }` to `{ campaign, winner, rounds }` — both callers needed the full Campaign for their downstream work (CLI for the transcript, demo for `replay(events.slice(0, cursor))`), so the prior split was a duplication.

**New panel**: [web/modes/fuzz-replay.ts](web/modes/fuzz-replay.ts) — read-only initiative list (HP, conditions, position, active marker) + the 5-button transport + a play/pause auto-advance at 350 ms per step + an outcome banner that hides while the cursor is mid-stream (showing the winner mid-scrub spoils the playback).

**Map panel removed** per user request. The grid view added marginal value at three tokens on a 6x4 grid and the demo's centre column was crowding the inspector. Dropped: `web/modes/grid-view.ts` (delete), the `#grid-view-root` section, the `.grid-*` CSS, and the three-column `.panels` template (now two columns). The historical archive entry at [docs/changelog/released-versions.md](docs/changelog/released-versions.md) was unlinked + tagged "(Removed in slice 600.)" matching the convention slice 584 set when it retired Rules Lab.

**Combat sandbox + scenario picker removed**: `web/modes/combat-sandbox.ts` (delete), the action-toolbar / OA-queue / scenario-hint CSS, and the scenario-picker `<select>`. [web/scenarios/](web/scenarios/) stays as a test fixture only — the four scenarios still drive [tests/integration/web-scenarios.test.ts](tests/integration/web-scenarios.test.ts) (replay-equivalence + headline-action probes for Frightened source-tracking, Misty Step occupancy, concentration auto-clear) which is the real value they were carrying.

**Bug fix during smoke-test**: the outcome banner originally showed the winner banner unconditionally and looked up the winner name in the *scrubbed* campaign — at cursor < CharacterCreated event-index, the lookup fell through to the raw ULID (e.g. `Winner: 01KT51WT1XWKT9DTZ9HXQRG7CJ in 11 rounds`). Fixed two ways at once: (1) resolve the winner name once against the full campaign at session start and pass it into the panel; (2) hide the outcome banner while `cursor < totalEvents` since the post-credits result spoils the playback. The cursor-update path was also adjusted so the panel's internal cursor syncs *before* `replaceCampaign()` notifies subscribers, otherwise the hash-driven seek path would flash the wrong outcome state for one frame.

**Files**: [scripts/combat-fuzz-core.ts](scripts/combat-fuzz-core.ts) (new, ~600 lines), [scripts/combat-fuzz.ts](scripts/combat-fuzz.ts) (slimmed to ~110 lines), [web/main.ts](web/main.ts) (full rewrite), [web/modes/fuzz-replay.ts](web/modes/fuzz-replay.ts) (new), [web/index.html](web/index.html), [web/styles.css](web/styles.css), [web/README.md](web/README.md), `web/modes/combat-sandbox.ts` (delete), `web/modes/grid-view.ts` (delete), [web/scenarios/index.ts](web/scenarios/index.ts) (clarify it's now a test fixture), [docs/changelog/released-versions.md](docs/changelog/released-versions.md) (unlink the removed-grid-view archive bullet).

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx tsc --noEmit -p web/tsconfig.json` both clean.
- `npx vitest run` full suite green (a transient `doc-links` failure on the first run after the README update — the grid-view archive link still pointed at the deleted file — was fixed in the same slice by unlinking the archive bullet matching the slice-584 convention).
- `npx tsx scripts/combat-fuzz.ts --count 2 --seed 100` writes the same transcripts the prior CLI did (the core extraction is behavior-preserving for the CLI).
- `npx vite --config vite.web.config.ts` boots the demo without runtime errors; manual interaction confirms transport buttons step the cursor, hash params round-trip, Run resets the session with new config values.

**Audit (doc / infra change, no engine work):**
- **Names**: `runBattle`, `FuzzBattleResult`, `FuzzRest`, `FuzzVs`, `mountFuzzReplay`, `buildScrubbed`, `findEncounterId`, `onSeek` all match the existing demo / fuzz conventions (`mount*` for panels, `build*` for state helpers).
- **DRY**: the simulator now has one source of truth — both the CLI and the demo `import { runBattle } from './combat-fuzz-core'`. The fuzz tool's behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged (same CLI smoke run produces the same transcript bytes), so the extraction is a refactor not a rewrite.
- **SRP**: `combat-fuzz-core.ts` simulates a battle; `combat-fuzz.ts` is the CLI; `fuzz-replay.ts` renders + transports; `main.ts` wires the host + cursor + URL. No file does two jobs.
- **Magic numbers**: `STEP_DELAY_MS = 350` named in `fuzz-replay.ts`; `DEFAULT_SEED = 42`, `DEFAULT_LEVEL = 1`, `DEFAULT_MODE = '1v1'`, `DEFAULT_VS`, `DEFAULT_REST` named in `main.ts`.
- **Tests prevent**: the existing audit suite (doc-size, doc-links, doc-examples, srd-drift, planner-wiring, coverage-ledger) caught the only regression introduced by the move — a deleted source file with a still-live archive link — and the fix kept the pattern (`code-formatted path + "(Removed in slice N.)"`) the codebase already uses.

**Pattern-check** (filter shape: "demo files that referenced the removed surfaces"): swept for `combat-sandbox`, `grid-view`, `CombatSandbox`, `mountGridView`, `mountCombatSandbox`, `scenario-control`, `oa-queue`, `action-toolbar` across `web/`, `tests/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`. All call sites resolved; the only collateral was the released-versions archive link fixed in the same slice. Scenarios stay because they remain useful test fixtures (their builders bake the regression cases the headline-action probes pin), not because they're load-bearing for the demo — that's a real consumer (`tests/integration/web-scenarios.test.ts`), not dead code.

**Docs (slice 599): README quick-start closes the loop on a real combat + adds post-import routing**

The previous README onboarding path stopped short. Its `<!-- typecheck -->` snippet built a character and printed a sheet, then dropped the reader into the repo structure table — no "see a combat" verification, no clear next-step routing for someone who'd just imported the library. A reader could clone the repo, run `npm test`, and still not see the engine actually resolve a combat without spelunking the examples directory.

**Changes** ([README.md](README.md), [examples/README.md](examples/README.md)):
- New "See it run a real combat in 5 seconds" subsection in Quick start: a single `npx tsx examples/02-combat-encounter/index.ts` invocation with the verbatim expected output (HP drop + replay-equivalent + RNG-free apply). Closes the "is this engine actually alive?" loop in the first scroll. The example was already runnable; the README just didn't advertise it.
- New "Want to watch random battles?" subsection: `combat-fuzz` CLI invocation with the flag matrix (`--level`, `--mode`, `--vs`, `--rest`) the slices 585-598 cycle built. Surfaces the engine's exhaustive battle-simulator without burying it in the script directory.
- New "Where do I go from here?" routing block right after the TS snippet: 5 bulleted reader-personas (tutorial → getting-started, runnable code → examples/, mental model → concepts, symbol lookup → api-overview, extending → recipes + CLAUDE.md). Mirrors the existing Documentation table at line ~92 but lives at the point a reader who just read the snippet would actually be looking for guidance.
- [examples/README.md](examples/README.md): added `00-quickstart` to the `npx tsx` run block — previously listed only 01/02/03 even though the directory exists.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsx examples/02-combat-encounter/index.ts` produces the README's quoted output verbatim (verified pre-commit).
- `npx tsx examples/00-quickstart/index.ts` produces `Alyx: AC 12, HP 26/26` (the README snippet's expected output line).
- `npx tsx scripts/combat-fuzz.ts --count 1 --seed 7` writes a battle transcript.
- doc-size + doc-links + doc-examples audits all green (the existing `<!-- typecheck -->` block remained untouched; the new content is prose + shell + a non-typechecked code-fence quote of program output).

**Audit:**
- **Names:** N/A (pure doc additions).
- **DRY:** the new bullets reference existing docs by file path; no content duplication.
- **SRP:** README onboarding flow only; engine / content / tests / fuzz unchanged.
- **Magic numbers:** N/A.
- **at-threading:** N/A.
- **Mechanical outcomes asserted:** doc audits green; quoted example output verified by actually running the command pre-edit.

**Pattern-check (filter shape: "docs that promise a thing but stop short of showing it"):** swept the top of README for other dropped-loops. The "Try it in your browser" link is concrete + actionable; the "Usage (preview)" section's `attack` / `castSpell` / `levelUp` snippets are honest about being preview shapes (the "Quick start" snippet is the only one that runs end-to-end); the "Documentation" routing table at line ~92 is structurally identical to the new bullets but lives below repo-structure — both are useful (one for orientation, one as catalog). Sweep clean.

## 0.1.0-alpha.15 - 2026-05-26

**Release (slice 471): bump to 0.1.0-alpha.15**

Promotes the post-alpha.14 cohort (slices 437-470) to a tagged release. `package.json` bumped from `0.1.0-alpha.14` to `0.1.0-alpha.15`; `package-lock.json` updated to match. `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 1: the cohort's two persisted-shape touches (slice 467 added `turnUsage.savageAttackerUsedThisTurn`, slice 468 added the `InitiativeSwapped` event) are both purely additive with safe defaults, so old saves parse unchanged. The full suite is green; doc-counts + doc-links + doc-size audits all pass.

Cohort, in two arcs:

- **Infra + docs sustainability (437-443):** the active-cycle CHANGELOG invariant that finally stopped the split-treadmill (437, `58.9 KB -> 9.5 KB` by evicting eight frozen release narratives to the per-range archives), the doc-links audit blind-spot fix for empty hrefs that the bulk re-rooting briefly produced (437 also), the broken-link fix in CLAUDE.md (438), the case-only link-mismatch hardening (439), documenting the PR-based `dev` -> `main` integration as standard (440), de-numbering the stale "Layer N" test labels (441), cutting CI turnaround from ~7 min per push to fast per-slice feedback (442), and syncing CLAUDE.md's branch section for fresh-agent readiness (443).
- **L1 playability arc (444-470):** the level-by-level direction shift. Three batches landed: species trait sweep (444-465) - Halfling Brave, Elf Fey Ancestry + Keen Senses, Darkvision / Dwarven Resilience / Gnomish Cunning, Rogue Thieves' Cant + Sprite natural weapons, Wolf / Dire Wolf / Brown Bear / Mastiff knock-prone, Goblin Nimble Escape, Zombie Undead Fortitude, Wizard Ritual Adept, Orc Adrenaline Rush + Relentless Endurance, Kobold Sunlight Sensitivity + the Undead sunlight sweep, Sprite + Ghoul Bite natural weapons, Cleric Turn Undead, monster Multiattack content declaration (canonical user: Ghoul), Human Skillful, Goliath species (closing the last empty playable species); background mechanics (466-469) - backgrounds auto-project their Origin Feat + Sage RAW correction (466), Savage Attacker (467, the Soldier mechanic), Alert (468, the Criminal mechanic), Magic Initiate (Cleric / Wizard) (469, the Sage / Acolyte mechanics); plus CHANGELOG cohort archives (454 → slices 444-450, 460 → slices 451-459, 470 → slices 460-468). Net result: every L1 species has wired traits, every L1 class feature is wired, every 2024 SRD background lights up end-to-end (proficiencies + Origin Feat mechanics) through the slice-466 auto-projection, and the monster Multiattack primitive is shipped for the next-arc encounter sweep.

Per-slice detail for the whole cohort is in the per-cohort archives under [docs/changelog/](docs/changelog/):
- [archive-slices-444-450.md](docs/changelog/archive-slices-444-450.md) (L1 arc part 1)
- [archive-slices-451-459.md](docs/changelog/archive-slices-451-459.md) (L1 arc part 2)
- [archive-slices-460-468.md](docs/changelog/archive-slices-460-468.md) (L1 arc part 3 - background mechanics)
- The pre-arc infra slices (437-443) plus slices 461 + 469-470 remain on the live release narrative below; future archive slices will continue to evict cohorts as they age.

**Content (slice 469): Magic Initiate x 2 (Cleric + Wizard) - Sage and Acolyte light up end-to-end**

The final pair of Origin Feats. After slice 466's auto-projection (background -> effective feat list -> effect stack) and slices 467 / 468's mechanic wiring for Savage Attacker / Alert, the only remaining "background ships with no effect" rows were Sage and Acolyte, both pending their Magic Initiate origin feats. This slice closes both with a pure-content slice: no engine work beyond what the slice-212 `GrantSpell` consumer already does.

RAW (SRD 5.2.1 Magic Initiate):
- **Two Cantrips**: "Learn two cantrips of your choice from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list."
- **Level 1 Spell**: "Choose a level 1 spell from the same list... You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have."
- **Repeatable**: different list each time. The pack already ships separate `magic-initiate-cleric` / `magic-initiate-wizard` feats, one per list; each background's Origin Feat fixes the list (Acolyte -> Cleric list, Sage -> Wizard list).

**Each feat ships two OfferChoice traits** ([src/content/packs/starter-pack.json](src/content/packs/starter-pack.json)), `when: 'onAcquire'`, each carrying `GrantSpell` per option:
- Cantrip OfferChoice (`oneOf: 2`): over the full SRD list for that class (7 Cleric, 15 Wizard). `preparation: 'always-prepared'` so the chosen cantrips appear on the bearer's effective spell list and can be cast at-will via the existing `cast-spell` planner.
- L1 OfferChoice (`oneOf: 1`): over the full SRD L1 list (15 Cleric, 30 Wizard). `preparation: 'oncePerLongRest'` — the slice-219 marker for "free cast" semantics. The spell still appears on `effectiveSpellList` so it's also castable using slots per RAW; the once-per-long-rest gate is consumer-tracked (same sibling-deferral as the slice-353 Warlock Contact Patron and slice-219 Cleric Divine Intervention).
- `spellcastingAbility`: hard-coded to the canonical default per RAW (`WIS` for Cleric list, `INT` for Wizard list). The player's choice across INT/WIS/CHA is deferred as a future refinement; for the auto-projected origin-feat path, the canonical default is the right out-of-the-box behavior.

**End-to-end through the background pipeline**: a consumer building an Acolyte / Sage character does **not** seed `featsTaken`. The slice-466 auto-projection delivers `magic-initiate-cleric` / `magic-initiate-wizard` to the effect stack from the background's `originFeatId`. The OfferChoice surfaces a pending choice on character acquisition; the consumer resolves it; the GrantSpell entries land on the bearer's `grantedSpells()` accumulator + `effectiveSpellList`.

**Tests** at [tests/unit/engine/slice-469-magic-initiate.test.ts](tests/unit/engine/slice-469-magic-initiate.test.ts) — 7 cases: (1, 2) Acolyte without choices resolved has no granted spells, Acolyte who picks Sacred Flame + Guidance + Cure Wounds has them granted with the right preparation modes and WIS ability; (3) the L1 spell appears on `effectiveSpellList` (castable via slots); (4, 5) Sage equivalents for Wizard list with INT ability; (6, 7) catalog-conformance checks pinning the OfferChoice shapes to the SRD list sizes (7 / 15 cleric, 15 / 30 wizard) so any future spell add / remove that walks past the catalog fails the audit.

**Audit (content slice):**
- *RAW match*: SRD 5.2.1 Magic Initiate exactly. The cantrip + L1 spell selection arms ship via OfferChoice over the full SRD lists. The "Spell Change at each level" arm (replace one chosen spell on level-up) is deferred — needs a `when: 'onLevelUp'` mode for OfferChoice the engine supports today but the SRD-replace shape is not yet conveyed by the OfferChoice schema. The free-cast-per-long-rest gate is consumer-tracked, matching the established pattern from slices 219 + 353.
- *Names*: `magic-initiate-cleric-cantrips` / `magic-initiate-cleric-l1` (and Wizard variants) mirror the existing `wizard-scholar` / `rogue-expertise-l1` / `rogue-expertise-l6` choice-id naming (subject-feature-variant).
- *DRY*: a single helper in the generator script produces both feats' OfferChoice arrays from the same SRD lists; the pack carries the resulting JSON inline so there's no runtime indirection.
- *SRP*: feat ships the choice surface; OfferChoice + GrantSpell are the existing primitives; `effectiveSpellList` does the union; no engine code touched.
- *Magic numbers*: only the `oneOf: 2` and `oneOf: 1` per RAW; the cantrip / spell counts are content-driven from the SRD lists.
- *Mechanical outcomes asserted*: no-choice-resolved -> no grants; chosen cantrips -> always-prepared; chosen L1 -> oncePerLongRest; spellcasting ability matches list (WIS / INT); spells appear on `effectiveSpellList`; OfferChoice shapes match the SRD list sizes.

**Closes the L1 background arc.** Every 2024 SRD background that ships in the starter pack (Soldier, Sage, Criminal, Acolyte) now lights up end-to-end: ability-score options, skill / tool proficiencies, languages, and Origin Feat mechanics. A consumer building any of the four with default `featsTaken: []` gets the RAW behavior automatically through the slice-466 auto-projection.

**Open follow-ups:**
- ~~**Once-per-long-rest free-cast gate**: a per-feat resource the engine auto-tracks (granted via the GrantSpell `oncePerLongRest` preparation, consumed by a cast with `noSlotCost: true`) would close the consumer-responsibility gap for Magic Initiate's L1-spell free cast, Warlock Contact Patron, and any other future once-per-long-rest cast. Sibling primitive opportunity.~~ **Closed by slice 486.**
- **Spell Change at level-up** (RAW: "Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat"): needs an OfferChoice mode that exposes a "replace one of your prior selections" semantic on level-up. The schema's `when: 'onLevelUp'` is there but the replace-prior-pick shape isn't expressed. *Still open.*
- **spellcastingAbility player choice** (RAW: pick INT/WIS/CHA at feat acquisition): a third OfferChoice on each feat over the three abilities, with each option re-projecting the GrantSpell entries with that ability. Deferred for now; the canonical defaults match the linked backgrounds' ability options. *Still open.*
- ~~**Magic Initiate (Druid)**: not currently in the pack as a feat; would mirror the Cleric / Wizard wiring over the Druid list once that list is fully present.~~ **Closed by slice 485.**

**Docs (slice 470): archive slices 460-468 (L1 background-mechanics arc) to free CHANGELOG headroom**

Pure CHANGELOG-archive operation. The live CHANGELOG had reached 62 KB after the slice-466 / 467 / 468 / 469 background arc — over the comfortable single-Read threshold. Moved the nine-slice cohort 460-468 to [docs/changelog/archive-slices-460-468.md](docs/changelog/archive-slices-460-468.md), continuing from [docs/changelog/archive-slices-451-459.md](docs/changelog/archive-slices-451-459.md) (L1 arc part 2). Slice 469 stays inline as the most-recent slice. Live CHANGELOG drops to ~25 KB; archive holds the full per-slice detail with sibling-rooted links (`../../src/...`, `../../tests/...`). Archive index in [docs/changelog/README.md](docs/changelog/README.md) updated.

**Docs (slice 443): sync CLAUDE.md's branch section to the PR flow (fresh-agent readiness)**

CLAUDE.md is the auto-loaded manual a fresh agent reads first, but its "Branch structure" still described the old "user merges `dev` into `main` on his cadence" local-merge framing and never mentioned the PR-based integration adopted in slice 440 (only DEVELOPMENT.md did). A fresh agent would get the correct "don't push without instruction" rule but a stale mental model of *how* integration happens. Updated [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) "Branch structure" to state `dev` integrates into `main` only through a CI-gated PR (with the `gh pr create` command + the per-push-vs-PR-gate split from slice 442), pointing to DEVELOPMENT.md for the full flow; broadened the git-safety line to "don't push, open a PR, or merge to `main` without instruction." Also fixed a stale parallel-authoring summary line that said "engine on `main`" (contradicting the dev-only rule; the underlying parallel-authoring.md was corrected in slice 433 but this CLAUDE.md summary wasn't). Pattern-checked the front-door docs for other local-merge framing: none remain. No code/content/public-surface change.

**Infra (slice 442): cut CI turnaround (~7 min per push -> fast per-slice feedback)**

CI ran a 3-way Node matrix (20/22/24) where every entry did `npm ci` + typecheck + coverage-instrumented suite + build, so the expensive trio ran 3x, with no concurrency cancellation (a re-push left the stale run going). Restructured [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) so the felt per-slice cost drops without weakening the gate on `main`:

- **Fast per-push `test` matrix**: Node 20/22/24 each run `npm test` (`vitest run`, no coverage) on every push/PR. Cross-Node compatibility is still exercised on all three; coverage % is Node-invariant for this no-native-deps library, so it no longer runs 3x.
- **Integration-time `quality` job**: typecheck + coverage (80% thresholds) + build, once on Node 22, gated via `if:` to pull requests and pushes to `main`. Routine `dev` pushes skip it; `main` is never shipped without it (dev -> main is PR-only). The CI coverage run drops the `html` reporter (text + json-summary suffice; thresholds read json-summary); local `npm run test:coverage` still emits html.
- **Concurrency cancellation**: a top-level `concurrency` group keyed on workflow + ref cancels a ref's in-flight run on re-push (no more ~14-min double-waits). Does not affect the deploy-*.yml workflows.
- **Nightly deep fuzz**: new [.github/workflows/nightly-fuzz.yml](.github/workflows/nightly-fuzz.yml) runs the property suite at `FAST_CHECK_NUM_RUNS=1000` on a daily schedule (+ manual dispatch), so deep fuzzing is continuous instead of never-in-CI while per-push fuzz stays at the smoke level (50).
- **`structuredClone` in [tests/property/content-pack-validator.test.ts](tests/property/content-pack-validator.test.ts)**: replaces the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` whole-pack deep clone done each fast-check iteration. Identical semantics on the plain-JSON pack; the file drops from ~43s to ~36s (the per-iteration Zod parse of the full pack, not the clone, is the remaining dominant cost) and the local pre-commit suite benefits too.

Quality is preserved: no tests deleted, coverage thresholds enforced before any merge to `main`, replay / RNG-capture / contract layers all still run, and local pre-commit still runs the full `vitest run` + `tsc` per slice. Documented the per-push-vs-gate split in DEVELOPMENT.md. Deliberately not done (low-risk bundle): test sharding + coverage-merge (the lever for sub-3-min single-run wall-clock, more plumbing) and hardcoding vitest `maxForks` (helps a 4-vCPU runner but can slow many-core local machines). No engine/content/public-surface change.

**Infra (slice 441): de-number the stale "Layer N" test labels (closes the slice-435 follow-up)**

Test-file headers and a few docs carried "Layer N" labels from an older 9+-layer testing scheme that no longer matched CLAUDE.md's current 1-7 Required-layers list (property tests were "Layer 7" and the feature-coverage matrix "Layer 8", but neither is a required layer; replay / RNG were "Layer 5 / 6" but are now 4 / 5). The numbers had drifted twice, so rather than re-number (which re-bitrots on the next reorder) the labels are now **de-numbered** to reference the standard by name. Updated `tests/property/*.test.ts` (7 files), `tests/coverage/features.test.ts`, and the `describe` labels in `tests/golden/{s2-combat-round,replay-equivalence,rng-capture}.test.ts` + `tests/integration/property.test.ts`; reconciled the stale inventory in [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) (was citing "Layers 5-11") and [docs/web-demo-plan.md](docs/web-demo-plan.md) ("Layer 9 contract test"); softened the one CLAUDE.md cross-reference. Left untouched by design: the SRD audit's own internally-consistent "Layer 1-4" scheme ([docs/srd-5.2.1-audit-classes.md](docs/srd-5.2.1-audit-classes.md), a different domain) and the frozen CHANGELOG archives (historical record). Verified the de-numbered `describe` labels carry no snapshot keys (only `tests/coverage/features.test.ts` uses snapshots, and only its comment changed) and the affected tests pass. No code/content/public-surface change.

**Docs (slice 440): document the PR-based dev -> main integration as standard**

Adopted a pull-request integration flow for `dev` -> `main` (replacing the local `git merge` that shipped a broken doc link straight to a red `main` in the slice-438 episode). Updated DEVELOPMENT.md: the "Branches" / "Working flow" now states that `main` is integrated only through a CI-gated PR (`gh pr create --base main --head dev`, merge when green), the branch-from rules note `dev` is the sole branch that integrates into `main` (via PR), and the "Cutting a release" step 7 ships through the PR before tagging on the merged `main`. The git-safety rule is unchanged: the PR process changes *how* `dev` integrates into `main`, not the rule that a human authorizes the push / PR / merge. Doc-only.

**Infra (slice 439): doc-links audit now catches case-only link mismatches**

The third and last of the "passes on a dev Mac, fails on Linux CI / GitHub" link classes (after empty hrefs in slice 437 and repo-escaping links in slice 438). macOS resolves `[x](docs/Status.md)` against the real `docs/status.md` (case-insensitive filesystem), so a wrong-case link passed the audit locally but would 404 on case-sensitive Linux CI and on GitHub. [tests/audit/doc-links.test.ts](tests/audit/doc-links.test.ts) now resolves each within-repo link by walking its path segments and requiring an exact-case match at each level (replacing the case-insensitive `existsSync`); on a mismatch it reports the correct casing (e.g. "case mismatch: should be docs/status.md"). Also dropped a stale unused `statSync` import. Verified it catches both wrong-case directory and wrong-case file segments and still passes clean. No code/content change.

**Fix (slice 438): CI doc-links failure - repo-escaping link in CLAUDE.md**

The doc-links audit failed in CI (but not locally): the project CLAUDE.md linked the global house-style file as `[~/.claude/CLAUDE.md](../../../.claude/CLAUDE.md)`, a path that resolves *above* the repo root. It passed on the dev machine (whose home dir has `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` at exactly that relative position) but 404s in CI and on GitHub, neither of which can escape the repo. Two fixes: (1) the global config isn't a repo file, so it's now referenced as plain `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` code text rather than a dead link; (2) hardened [tests/audit/doc-links.test.ts](tests/audit/doc-links.test.ts) to flag any link resolving above the repo root as broken, deterministically, so a non-portable link can no longer pass locally and fail in CI. Verified the audit catches an injected repo-escaping link and still passes clean. No code/content change.

**Docs (slice 437): make the CHANGELOG sustainable - live file holds only the active cycle**

The live CHANGELOG kept hovering at 57-59 KB despite repeated "splits" because the splits only moved per-slice *detail* to cohort archives while eight frozen release narratives (alpha.6-13, ~84% of the bytes) plus a 33-entry archive index stayed inline forever; each split reclaimed detail but added a pointer, so the floor never dropped. Restructured to an active-cycle-only invariant: the live CHANGELOG now holds only `## Unreleased` + the latest tagged release + a compact "Older releases" pointer (58.9 KB -> 9.5 KB). Evicted the alpha.6-13 release narratives to [docs/changelog/released-versions-alpha-6-13.md](docs/changelog/released-versions-alpha-6-13.md) and moved the global per-cohort archive index to [docs/changelog/README.md](docs/changelog/README.md), both link-re-rooted and under the ceiling. Codified the rule in CLAUDE.md "Doc size discipline" (on every release, evict the previously-latest release narrative + its cohort pointers; released narratives split by version range as they grow) and added the eviction step to the DEVELOPMENT.md "Cutting a release" checklist. The bulk re-rooting surfaced (and the slice fixed) a blind spot in [tests/audit/doc-links.test.ts](tests/audit/doc-links.test.ts): its link regex required a non-empty href, so an empty `[text]()` link (which renders dead on GitHub, and which the re-rooting briefly produced) slipped through; hardened it to flag empty hrefs. Test-only audit change otherwise; doc-links + doc-size green.
